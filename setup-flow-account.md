# Flow Account Setup Guide

## Current Issue
Your private key `7e70bf97178b46dfe4bff4fd8629bdded6b7fa4ae93d30f4c78b4a2c2844659a` doesn't match the account `0x1cf42ad65f227d9d`.

## Solution: Create New Account

### Step 1: Get Your Public Key
Your public key for the private key is:
```
23e71c7f0a5022e61d6d9933ccc1dad6768709b7e4c08c034babf931abaa2f6894eb856c08b81f8b52f4e17cd1110d99ff3b2ce9c6c9641600508d0c6f05799b
```

### Step 2: Create New Flow Account
1. Go to: https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/
2. Click "Create Account"
3. Paste your public key: `23e71c7f0a5022e61d6d9933ccc1dad6768709b7e4c08c034babf931abaa2f6894eb856c08b81f8b52f4e17cd1110d99ff3b2ce9c6c9641600508d0c6f05799b`
4. Click "Create and Fund Account"
5. Copy the new account address

### Step 3: Update Configuration
Update `.env.local` with your new account address:
```env
FLOW_ADMIN_ADDRESS=YOUR_NEW_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
VITE_BOOKVERSE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=YOUR_NEW_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```

Update `flow.json`:
```json
{
  "accounts": {
    "admin": {
      "address": "YOUR_NEW_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
      "key": "7e70bf97178b46dfe4bff4fd8629bdded6b7fa4ae93d30f4c78b4a2c2844659a"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Deploy Contract
After updating the addresses, run:
```bash
flow project deploy --network testnet
```

## Alternative: Use Correct Private Key
If you have the correct private key for account `0x1cf42ad65f227d9d`, update `.env.local` with that key instead.

## Current Status
✅ Frontend is running at http://localhost:8081
✅ All import errors fixed
✅ Components ready for wallet testing
⏳ Need correct Flow account setup for contract deployment

## Test the App Now
Even without contract deployment, you can:
1. Visit http://localhost:8081
2. Test the UI components
3. See the Flow wallet integration (will show "no contract" until deployed)
4. Test the achievement tracking system
5. Test the reading streak functionality
